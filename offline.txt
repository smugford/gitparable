Zoes travel habits cause her to spend countless hours on airplanes and boats. Most of the places she visits have no readily available internet access. At the end of the day, she spends more time offline than online.

Its no surprise, then, that Zoe raves about your VCS. All of the day to day operations that she needs to do can be done locally. The only time she needs a network connection is when sheâ€™s ready to share her snapshots with you.
