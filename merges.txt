Before Zoe left on her trip, you had asked her to start working off of the branch named ‘math’ and to implement a function that generated prime numbers. Meanwhile, you were also developing off of the ‘math’ branch, only you were writing a function to generate magic numbers. Now that Zoe has returned, you are faced with the task of merging these two separate branches of development into a single snapshot. Since you both worked on separate tasks, the merge is simple. While constructing the snapshot message for the merge, you realize that this snapshot is special. Instead of just a single parent, this merge snapshot has two parents! The first parent is your latest on the ‘math’ branch and the second parent is Zoe’s latest on her ‘math’ branch. The merge snapshot doesn’t contain any changes beyond those necessary to merge the two disparate parents into a single codebase.

Once you complete the merge, Zoe fetches all the snapshots that you have that she does not, which include your development on the ‘math’ branch and your merge snapshot. Once she does this, both of your histories match exactly!
